<p>Extra juicy and filled with flavor, these bite-sized morsels of pork are trimmed from the ends of spareribs. Slow-cooking these mostly boneless tidbits will maximize their flavor and their melting tenderness. Prepare them the same way that you would pork ribs: smoke and smother in barbecue sauce, broil with hoisin sauce or steam with Chinese black beans.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The collection of family-operated farms ensures a year-round supply of organic pigs that are raised without hormones, antibiotics, or animal byproducts. They are always humanely treated, which means they are never kept in farrowing or gestation crates and have access to outdoor pasture and clean straw winter bedding and shelter. The unique Duroc/Landrace/Berkshire crossbreed ensures consistent, well-marbled, and juicy—yet not overly fatty—pork. The best, cleanest tasting pork comes from well-cared-for pigs raised in their natural environment on high-quality, all-vegetable, organic grain-fed diets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The pork equivalent of prime rib, this flavorful cut is from the very center of the loin, the best part of the pig for flavor and tenderness. It has the deepest meaty taste, and the way we custom-cut and tie it makes for a dramatic presentation. Figure on at least one rib per person and don’t cook it past medium or you risk drying it out.</p>
